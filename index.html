					One of the obstacles in research activities concentrating on environmental sound classiﬁcation is the scarcity of suitable and publicly available datasets
					 .The project provides an evaluation of human accuracy in classifying environmental sounds and compares it to the performance of selected baseline classiﬁers using features derived from DFT.

					Main aim of the project is to identify audio features suitable of differentiating non speech audio signals majorly environmental and urban sounds. Preferred audios we have used are ambient noises from an urban environment.The number of different audio classes we have been working are of four categories.It's applications are in various ways such as building an audio device which can identify or detect the external objects like identifying a car among several vehicles in traffic and differentiating it to that of chirping of birds or lot of other sounds.Various types of spectrograms of samples from each class have been plotted leading us to find suitable classification techniques.Features we used are spectralspread,flux,powerratio,slope,kurtosis,flatness,decrease,centroid,crest,rolloff,skewness which are of DFT based computed using Short Time Fourier Transform.

This project  includes details on sound digitization,transforms,structure of environmental sounds from a human perspective.This project will cover the area of non-speech environmenal sound classification by analysis of non speech sound recognition techniques.A comparitive analysis is also made in identifying those speech and sound recognition techniques that can be used in non speech sound recognition.It explains about the time-frequency techniques and their applicability to the domain.

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						Initially the main task of this approach is to gather a huge dataset of several kinds of environmental sounds like urban sounds,domestic sounds etc.More preferably these samples of dataset are pre-emphasised by removing noise,silence and other sort of distortions.These preprocessed dataset is used to extract the features that will be able classify the selected audio classes of non speech sounds.Feature extracted so are then used as inputs to the for the part of classification through clustering of those chosen  classes.Accuracy of this classification is verified and improved further to get better way of identifying our classes
